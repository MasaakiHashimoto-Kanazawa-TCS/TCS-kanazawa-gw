# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TCS-kanazawa-gwプロジェクトは植物監視システムを構築するプロジェクトですが、現在の構成には整理が必要な問題があります。プロジェクト構造を標準化し、開発効率を向上させ、保守性を高めるための構成整理を行います。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear and organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer opens the project THEN the project SHALL have a clear directory structure with appropriate naming conventions
2. WHEN examining the root directory THEN the project SHALL have a comprehensive README.md that explains the overall system architecture
3. WHEN looking at each component THEN each component SHALL have its own README.md with setup and usage instructions
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN there SHALL be no conflicting or outdated dependency versions between components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent dependency management across all components, so that I can avoid version conflicts and ensure reproducible builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining PlantMonitor THEN the system SHALL use either pyproject.toml OR requirements.txt, not both
2. WHEN checking PlantMonitorPage THEN the system SHALL have a proper package.json file with all necessary dependencies
3. WHEN comparing dependency versions THEN all shared dependencies SHALL use compatible versions
4. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN each component SHALL have clear installation instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration management, so that I can easily set up different environments (development, staging, production).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN each component SHALL have proper environment configuration files
2. WHEN examining configuration THEN sensitive information SHALL be properly handled through environment variables
3. WHEN deploying THEN there SHALL be clear separation between development and production configurations
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN there SHALL be example configuration files with documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused or incomplete components removed, so that the project remains clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the MQTTtest directory THEN it SHALL either contain functional code or be removed
2. WHEN checking for unused files THEN obsolete or duplicate files SHALL be removed
3. WHEN reviewing components THEN each component SHALL have a clear purpose and be actively used
4. WHEN maintaining the project THEN there SHALL be no dead code or unused dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized development workflows, so that all team members can work efficiently with consistent processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN there SHALL be standardized scripts for common tasks (start, build, test, deploy)
2. WHEN examining the project THEN there SHALL be consistent code formatting and linting configurations
3. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN there SHALL be proper build and deployment configurations
4. WHEN contributing code THEN there SHALL be clear development guidelines and contribution instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation structure, so that I can understand the system architecture and component interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN there SHALL be architectural documentation explaining component relationships
2. WHEN looking at API endpoints THEN there SHALL be proper API documentation
3. WHEN checking data flow THEN there SHALL be clear documentation of data flow between components
4. WHEN onboarding THEN there SHALL be step-by-step setup guides for each component
